# CSGO Overwatch Bot

Automatically solves Overwatch cases. Although **the detection algorithm for Aimbotting, AFKing & Wallhack are really bad and there is no Team harm detection**.

When running this you will get some unhandled cases which we simply don't care about.

You can forcefully parse a demo by simply putting it in the directory and running `node force.js`. You will get prompted to enter the name of the demo and the SteamID of your suspect.

# Installation

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Clone this repository and extract it in a folder
3. Open a command prompt inside the directory
4. Run `npm install`
5. Make a duplicate of the `config.json.example` and remove the `.example`
6. Adjust your now called `config.json` - [See Config](#config)
7. Run `node index.js`
8. After every update repeat from step 2 onwards to ensure everything required is up to date

# Detections

- **Aimbot**:
- - Log the past X ticks, when the suspect gets a kill check all angles within the past X ticks. If the difference is above the threshold add an infraction.
- **AFKing**:
- - Everytime the round starts log the current position of the player on every tick, at the end of the round compare all the positions. If the player did not leave a specific radius within the entire round add an infraction.
- **Wallhack**:
- - On every kill just check if the event included the `penetrated` parameter and if its 1 or higher, meaning the last bullet was a wallbang. It will not work when the player only damages through a wall instead of killing.

# Rich Presence

Rich Presence is what displays on your friends when they play a game. Such as `In CS:GO Overwatch Session`.

There **MUST** always be a `steam_display` parameter and it **MUST** be a string from [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/730/localization/) everything else can be any text you want.

If you want to display the default text enter invalid text, completely omit `richPresence` or set `richPresence` to an empty object (`{}`).

You can view the current Rich Presence keys and values in your browser [on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/testrichpresence) if you are logged in.

## Example 1 (Basic):

Set `steam_display` to `#display_watch` to display `Watching a CS:GO Match`

The structure would look like this:

```
{
    "steam_display": "#display_watch"
}
```

## Example 2 (Advanced):

Some keys in the localizations include placeholders (Example `%game:mode%`). You have to fill in those placeholders yourself and Steam will put the text you defined in there.

For example if we set `steam_display` to `#display_lobby` then the text will be `In Lobby - {#gamemode_%game:mode%}`

We want to replace `%game:mode%` with `competitive` because `#gamemode_competitive` translates to `Competitive` (Because if we take `#gamemode_%game:mode%` and replace `%game:mode%` with `competitive` then it will be `#gamemode_competitive`).

So we now have to set another value called `game:mode` to `competitive` and then it will display `In Lobby - Competitive`.

The structure would look like this:
```
{
    "steam_display": "#display_lobby",
    "game:mode": "competitive"
}
```

## Example 3 (Advanced):

With the knowledge of [Example 2](#example-2-advanced) we can now search a localization token which does not have a prefix, like `#bcast_teamvsteammap` which looks like this: `%team1% vs %team2% | {#gamemap_%map%}`. `team1` and `team2` have no translation prefix so therefore we can put in any value we want, unlike for `map`.

To display `Minecraft vs Roblox | Phoenix Compound` we have to set our structure to this:
```
{
    "steam_display": "#bcast_teamvsteammap",
    "team1": "Minecraft",
    "team2": "Roblox",
    "map": "coop_cementplant"
}
```

# GameCoordinator

How Overwatch data is exchanged between GC and Client. The data shown below has been collected from only a single Overwatch case, results may vary depending on the case we get.

1. Send `CMsgGCCStrike15_v2_PlayerOverwatchCaseUpdate`
   - `reason` (Ex: `1`)
   - - I assume this tells the GC we are waiting for a new case
2. Wait for `CMsgGCCStrike15_v2_PlayerOverwatchCaseAssignment`
   - `caseid` (Ex: `331349...`)
   - - Case identifier
   - `caseurl` (Ex: `http://replay192.valve.net...`)
   - - The download URL for the entire demo, not just the specific Overwatch
   - `verdict` (Ex: `0`)
   - - Unknown
   - `throttleseconds` (Ex: `4800`)
   - - I assume this is the time between cases, although 1.5 hours makes little sense
   - `suspectid` (Ex: `909243640`)
   - - Account ID of the suspect. (`[U:1:<SUSPECTID>]` for SteamID3)
   - `fractionid` (Ex: `11`)
   - - Unknown
   - `numrounds` (Ex: `19`)
   - - The round the demo starts at
   - `fractionrounds` (Ex: `8`)
   - - How many rounds we watch
   - `streakconvictions` (Ex: `1`)
   - - I assume this is how many correct convictions we got in a row. Although why would it be shown to us?
3. *Download the demo*
4. Send `CMsgGCCStrike15_v2_PlayerOverwatchCaseStatus`
   - `caseid` (Ex: `331349...`)
   - - Our case identifier
   - `statusid` (Ex: `1`)
   - - I assume this tells the GC we are currently assigned to a case and have successfully downloaded it
5. *Analyse the demo file*
6. Send `CMsgGCCStrike15_v2_PlayerOverwatchCaseUpdate`
   - `caseid` (Ex: `331349...`)
   - - Our case identifier
   - `suspectid` (Ex: `909243640`)
   - - Our suspect
   - `fractionid` (Ex: `11`)
   - - Unknown
   - `rpt_aimbot` (Ex: `1`)
   - - Did this user have aimbot?
   - `rpt_wallhack` (Ex: `1`)
   - - Did this user have wallhack?
   - `rpt_speedhack` (Ex: `1`)
   - - Did this user have any other external assistance?
   - `rpt_teamharm` (Ex: `0`)
   - - Did this user grief?
   - `reason` (Ex: `3`)
   - - I assume this tells the GC we have finished the demo and made our verdict
7. Wait for `CMsgGCCStrike15_v2_PlayerOverwatchCaseAssignment`
   - `caseid` (Ex: `331349...`)
   - - Our case identifier
   - `verdict` (Ex: `2`)
   - - Unknown (Previous information was false, I just got one with `1` instead of `2`)
   - `throttleseconds` (Ex: `7`)
   - - I assume this tells our client to wait this many seconds before we are allowed a new case
8. *Repeat*

If we start the game with a Overwatch case already being assigned to us the GC wil respond with the same assigned case we got earlier. It might also respond with a new case incase our old case has expired, this is untested though.
